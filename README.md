## This branch is dedicated for a `FAISS` clustering.

Well, we'd like to do cluster the unlabeled images using FAISS to give them labels.  

* Choose the best index based on our labeled data

    * However, we have noticed that the most serious problem is the choice of image descriptor

* Use this approach to give the labels to unlabeled data 

> Finally, train model on whole data.
